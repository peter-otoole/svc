# node-mssql-connector

CurrentVersion: `0.2.0`

This is a NodeJS module to connect to MSSQL databases and executed queries or stored procedures. This plugin is based on [tedious by Mike D Pilsbury](http://pekim.github.io/tedious/index.html). 

The plugin is written in CoffeeScript.

Take a lot of changes in [Changelog](#changelog)

# Basics
- Supports all simple SQL- Statements like `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT` etc.
- Supports multiple connections via `tedious-connection-pool`.
- *Stored procedures* can be executed
- Get the data in JSON format
- Run the test to check that everything is correct


# Installation

`npm install node-mssql-connector`


# Example

## Use In NodeJS

### Initialize node-mssql-connector

```
MSSQLConnector = require( "node-mssql-connector" )
MSSQLClient = new MSSQLConnector( {
	settings: {
		max: 20,
		min: 0,
		idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
	},
	connection: {
		userName: "",
		password: "",
		server: "",
		options: {
			database: ""
		}
	}
```



## SQL statement  

First define the query statement.

```
query = MSSQLClient.query( "
	SELECT ID, Name, Lastname
	FROM Table
	WHERE id = @id
")
```

Set the parameters. Values with leading `@` are defined as parameters.
If there aren't any parameter you do not need the following line.  
 
**Important** You have to use the *correct datatype* from tedious. They can be found here (column "Constant"): [http://pekim.github.io/tedious/api-datatypes.html](http://pekim.github.io/tedious/api-datatypes.html)

```
query.param( "id", "Int",  23 )
```

Execute the query. The result will be returned as an `Array` with an `Object` for each result.


```
query.exec( function( err, res ){
	if( err ){
		console.error( err );
		return
	}
	
	/*
	
	The result looks like this:
	
	{ 
		result:[ 
			{ 
   				id: 23,
       			name: "Testuser"",
       			lastname: "Testlast" 
       		} 
       	],
  		rowcount: 1 
  	}
  	
  	*/
	
})
```

## Stored procedure

The stored procedure in database looks like:

``` 
...
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_demo] 

@ID Int,
@Total Tinyint = 0 Output,
@Teststring Varchar(100) = 'Default' Output
AS

SET @Teststring = "Modifed"

SET @Total = 100

SELECT ID, Name, Lastname
FROM Table
WHERE ID = @id
```

The difference to **SQL Statment** is that you have to call the `storedprod` method of **MSSQLClient**. If your stored procedure has output params (like in this example) then you must define this via `storedprod.outParam`

```
storedprod = MSSQLClient.storedprod( "tedious_get2" )
storedprod.param( "id", "Int",  23 )
storedprod.outParam( "Total", "Int" )
storedprod.outParam( "Teststring", "VarChar"" )
storedprod.exec( function( err, res ){
	if( err ){
		console.error( err );
		return
	}
	
	/*
	
	The result looks like this. The paran 'output' is only by stored procedures.
	
	{ 
		result:[ 
			{ 
   				id: 23,
       			name: "Testuser"",
       			lastname: "Testlast" 
       		} 
       	],
       	output: [ 
       		{ 
       			Total: 100 
       		}, 
       		{ 
       			Teststring: "Modifed" 
       		} 
       	],
  		rowcount: 1 
  	}
  	
  	*/
	
})

```
  
# <a name="changelog"></a>Changelog

`v0.2.0`

- Change the complete error handling. Errors will now always be returned as an object in the callback method:
	
	```
	// Example of an error whcih happens when there will be more params set than in query 
	query = MSSQLClient.query( "
			SELECT * 
			FROM Table
			WHERE id = @id
	" )
	query.param( "id", "Int",  100 )
	query.param( "otherfield", "Int",  200 )
	query.exec( function( err, res ){
		console.log( err );
		
		/*
			Result
						
			{ 
				name: 'param-not-found',
  				message: 'Param 'otherfield' was not found in query or is tried to set twice' 
  			}	
  				
		*/
	});
	```
	This is already implemented into the tests.

`v0.1.2`

- Implement connection pool.

# Not implemented yet
- Test for inserting stored procedures
- Test for run stored procedures
- Check if database exists
